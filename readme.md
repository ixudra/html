![LaravelCollective HTML](LaravelCollectiveHTML-banner.png)

This is a fork of the original [LaravelCollective/Html](https://github.com/LaravelCollective/html) repository created for the sole purpose of providing Laravel 11 support. I have no desire or intentions to further develop this package and will remove it if and when the original repository is updated. Use at your own leisure but also at your own risk.

Official documentation for Forms & Html for The Laravel Framework can be found at the [LaravelCollective](https://laravelcollective.com/docs) website.
